// This file declares VIP configurations that are currently omitted from monitoring by VIP watchdog.
//
// Ideally, this list would be empty; however, bugs in our monitoring necessitate a way for us to temporarily exclude
// one or more VIPs from monitoring until the bug can be fixed.
//
// This is a rather large hammer -- VIPs filtered from monitoring do not receive any SLA guarantees, and VIP metrics
// (availability, backend health, etc), are not emitted to Argus. Use with caution. Bias for fixing the monitoring
// bug rather than adding to this list. When adding to this list, include a detailed comment (or link to a work item)
// indicating why the VIP is being filtered and when the filter can be expected to be removed.
//
// The structure of the JSON object is like:
// {
//    <controlEstate>: // The name of the k8s control estate hosting the VIP.
//    {
//      serviceLists:  // Optional. If included, specifies one or more service lists to exclude from monitoring.
//      [
//        ...
//      ],
//      namespaces:    // Optional. If included, specifies one or more namespaces to exclude from monitoring.
//      [
//        ...
//      ],
//    },
// },
//
// A "service list" is an internal SLB concept. It has a mapping for both k8s services and self-service vips.
// * For VIPs bound to a raw k8s service, the "service list" name is the name of the k8s service declaring the VIP.
// * For SAM apps, the "service list" name corresponds to the "lbname" field in the SAM manifest.
// * For self-service VIPs, the "service list" name is the "customlbname" field (if specified), otherwise it is formed
//   from:
//   - the "lbname" field in the VIP declaration,
//   - the team / user name from the folder containing the vips.yaml,
//   - the kingdom name:
//   <lbname>-<team/username>-<kingdom>
//
// Similarly, the "namespace" used here depends on whether the VIP is bound to a k8s service or self-service:
// * For VIPs bound to a k8s service, the namespace is the containing namespace for the service resource.
// * For SAM apps, the namespace is the team / user name.
// * For self-service VIPs, the namespace is always "kne".

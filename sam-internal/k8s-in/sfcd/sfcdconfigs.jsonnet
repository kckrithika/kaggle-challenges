        # NOTE:
        # Each phase is overlayed on the next phase.
        # This means that for things that are the same everywhere,
        # you are free to simply define it only in Phase4 and all the rest will inherit it.

        ### Release Phase 0 - prd-samtest
        "0": $.per_phase["1"] {
            },

        ### Release Phase 1 - prd-samdev
        # See https://git.soma.salesforce.com/sam/sam/wiki/Deploy-SAM on how to pick the correct tag
        # As much as possible, we want to use a tag that is running well in phase 0 above.
        # When rolling this phase, remove all overrides from test beds above
        # Make sure there are no critical watchdogs firing before/after the release, and check emails to make sure all rolled properly

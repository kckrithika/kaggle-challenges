# Mesh Control Plane
## Istio Pilot Update, Upgrade & Deployment 
The [templates](./templates) directory contains the Istio k8s resources auto-generated from the [Istio helm charts](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/install/kubernetes/helm/istio) using [Replicated Ship](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship) and [Internal Istio Upgrade Tool](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/servicemesh/istio-upgrade). 

The [`istio-init-ship`](./istio-init-ship) directory contains Ship's workspace to convert `istio-init` helm charts to [yaml with embedded jsonnet variables](./istio-init-ship/rendered.yaml). The Istio Upgrade tool converts this single yaml which contains multiple Istio resources to separate jsonnet templates and populates them in [`templates/istio-init-autogenerated`](./templates/istio-init-autogenerated) directory. 
If there are changes in `istio-init`, first create and apply a PR for `istio-init-ship` changes in SAM pipeline before moving on to `istio-ship`. 
`istio-init` contains initialization resources which are required by Istio. So, it needs to be applied before other standard Istio resources.

The [`istio-ship`](./istio-ship) directory contains Ship's workspace to convert `istio` helm charts to [yaml with embedded jsonnet variables](./istio-ship/rendered.yaml). The Istio Upgrade tool converts this single yaml which contains multiple Istio resources to separate jsonnet templates and populates them in [`templates/istio-autogenerated`](./templates/istio-autogenerated) directory.

[`./build.sh`](../build.sh) converts the auto-generated jsonnet templates to yaml with SAM config values populated in place of the jsonnet variables.

**Notes:**
1. Files that end with **.TEMPLATE** suffix are not processed by the build script.
1. Some files in the templates directory are added manually like the `Policy` object till we find a better place for it.

### Upgrade Specific Steps
1. To prevent Ship from auto-upgrading base each time we update overlays, Ship is pinned to specific commit.
1. Find the commit corresponding to the [release we are upgrading](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/).
1. Update the commit in [`istio-ship/.ship/state.json`](istio-ship/.ship/state.json) & [`istio-init-ship/.ship/state.json`](istio-init-ship/.ship/state.json) `upstream` attribute.
1. If there are repo aliases defined in the new verions's helm requirements 
[like this example](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/1.1.0-snapshot.6/install/kubernetes/helm/istio/requirements.yaml#L64) 
then you may need to [read this GUS work item](https://gus.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/ADM_Work__c/a07B0000005zh55IAA/view) 
before running `ship update --headed`.
1. Run `ship update --headed` in both the directories following the steps below.
1. Ship has old `values.yaml` stored in state.json. Update to new values in the Step 1 as required. Copy contents of new values.yaml and paste. 
A copy of the same values with Mesh Control Plane defaults is in [`istio-helm-mcp-defaults`](./istio-helm-mcp-defaults) which helps to check diff during upgrade.

### Update/Upgrade and Deployment Steps (Skip steps as required based on the action)
1. If updating Istio images, update the new image as required in [istio-images.jsonnet](./istio-images.jsonnet). Note: Phased deployment not decided yet for istio, only phase 0 active.
1. If updating the estates Istio runs on, update the [istio-pilot-estates.json](./istio-pilot-estates.json).
1. If updating overlays, ensure [Ship is installed](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship#installation), navigate to [istio-ship](./istio-ship) directory and run `ship update --headed`.
1. If updating overlays, complete all the steps in Ship's visual UI. Jsonnet variables in overlays can be represented as `mcpIstioConfig.<name>` or `%(<name>)s`. Where, `<name>` is the variable name defined in [`istio-config.jsonnet`](./istio-config.jsonnet).
1. Run [`./generate-istio-templates.sh`](./generate-istio-templates.sh) script. This will auto-generate jsonnet templates in [templates](./templates) directory based on the [rendered.yaml](./istio-ship/rendered.yaml).
1. Run [`./build.sh`](../build.sh) script in [`k8s-in` directory](../). This will generate the k8s yamls in [`k8s-out` directory](../../k8s-out) as per the estates.
1. If you would like to verify the generated k8s resource files, apply them directly to your local k8s cluster or to prd-samtest only. Ensure you are in the intended kubectl context.
1. Create PR for review.
1. Once the PR is authorized, the SAM TNRP pipeline should take care of the deployment. Use the links mentioned in [SAM Auto Deployer](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/sam/sam/wiki/Debugging-SAM-Auto-Deployer) to check the deployment progress and errors.
1. Verify Istio deployments and Istio test apps are running fine based on the steps mentioned below.

### Verification
Istio test apps are deployed in `prd-sam` in `service-mesh` namespace. Please ensure the apps are running as expected after any modifications. Once metrics support is added, we will add alerts for the same.
```
$ kubectl config use-context prd-sam
Switched to context "prd-sam".

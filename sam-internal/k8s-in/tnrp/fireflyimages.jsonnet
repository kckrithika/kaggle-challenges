    # ================== Firefly RELEASE ====================
    # Releases should follow the order below unless there are special circumstances.  Each phase should use the
    # image from the previous stage after a 24 hour bake time with no issues (check that all watchdogs are healthy)
    ##

    ### Global overrides - Anything here will override anything below
    overrides: {
        #
        # This section lets you override any Firefly image for a given kingdom,estate,template,image.
        # Image name
        #
        # Example:
        #   # [alias] Added this override to fix issue xxx
        #   "prd,prd-samtwo,firefly-rabbitmq-rcs,rabbitmq": "xxxxx",

        },

    ### Per-phase image tags
    per_phase: {

        ### Release Phase 0 - Nightly deployment of the most recent firefly to prd-samtest
        # Under normal cirumstances we should not need to change this section.
        # Overrides work just fine in this phase.

        # NOTE:
        # Each phase is overlayed on the next phase.  This means that for things that are the same everywhere
        # you are free to simply define it only in Phase4 and all the rest will inherit it.

        ### Release Phase 0 - prd-samtest

        ### Release Phase 1 - prd-samdev
        # See https://git.soma.salesforce.com/sam/sam/wiki/Deploy-SAM on how to pick the correct tag
        # As much as possible, we want to use a tag that is running well in phase 0 above.
        # When rolling this phase, remove all overrides from test beds above
        # Make sure there are no critical watchdogs firing before/after the release, and check emails to make sure all rolled properly

    # Static images that do not go in phases
    # [Important Note]: When you are changing images in for initContainers/sidecars  they are not promoted to prod by default. This need to be

    # Please be very careful when making such a change

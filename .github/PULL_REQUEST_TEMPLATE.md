<!-- Instructions for submitting a PR to sam/manifests:
Remember to run validate.sh before creating a PR to catch issues early.

After creating the PR, a comment from the Firefly service will show up with instructions for validating and merging your change.
See https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PSD&title=Firefly+Home for details.

ATTENTION! All PRs that change production need approvals from one of Srini's or Jim's direct reports.  See https://gus.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/0D5B000000yrjw0KAA/view  SAM is in the process of adding the new required checks, and when those are signed off we will remove this requirement.

SAM will soon require valid GUS change cases for every PR that impacts production.  Please include the GUS case number in the PR description or in a comment.  The correct format is `GUS Case: xxxxxx`

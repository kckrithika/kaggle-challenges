Remember to run validate.sh before creating a PR to catch changes early.

A few seconds after the PR is created or updated a comment will show up with a link "I approve these changes".  For changes to PRD, the PR author can click this link and start the validation+merge process.  For Prod changes, another person in access.yaml will need to approve.

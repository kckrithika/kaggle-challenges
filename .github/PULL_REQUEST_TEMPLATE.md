<!-- Instructions for submitting a PR to sam/manifests:
Remember to run validate.sh before creating a PR to catch issues early.

After creating the PR, a comment from the Firefly service will show up with instructions for validating and merging your change.
See https://confluence.internal.salesforce.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PSD&title=Firefly+Home for details.

It is now REQUIRED to create a GUS change case for every PR submitted to the repo. The corresponding case number must be
included in either the PR description or in a comment. This must be in the following format:
'GUS Case: xxxxxxxx'

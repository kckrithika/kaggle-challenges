## This VIP definition creates a VIP named ssh-to-somewhere-slb-examples-prd.slb.sfdc.net
## This VIP listens on port 22 and forwards packets port 22 on one of the specified backends. 
## Traffic is only sent to backend servers if they satisfy the specified health probe.
## This contrived allows for a user to ssh to a randomly selected member of backend pool.

# lbname specifies the unqualified name of the VIP. In PRD-SAM, for example,
# the name would be lbname-user-prd.slb.sfdc.net, where 'user' represents
# your user namespace under sam/manifests/app/user/

  # port specifies the port upon which the VIP listens. targetport specifies
  # the port on the backend pool member that actually receives the traffic.
  # Packets sent to lbname:port will be sent to server:targetport

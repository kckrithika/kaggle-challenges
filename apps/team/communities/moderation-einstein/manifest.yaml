    # maps the logval volumeMount to a directory on the host machine. Logs in this directory will be available
    # for a short time after a docker image is shut down. The SAM splunk forwarders will handle the logs being
    # written to this directory.
    # TBD: SAM is still implementing the splunk forwarding functionality. This location may change.
